# Pose detection

In this project, we aim to understand the ideal position of the body during sports. By training our model on the joint data of the human body in different correct poses, we implement a live time tracking of the human body poses to prevent injury.

We further aim to implement the same system in the rehabilation from an injury based on past data and injury history.
